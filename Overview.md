# Introduction

Below you will find details about the general structure of our lab, including how we meet, communicate, give feedback, and share resources.

## How we meet

We meet in-person every week in the LOC Lab in Bren Hall 1310. For folks who are traveling, they can attend via zoom. For one-on-one meetings with Joan, remember to send calendar invites with a zoom link if meeting online.
Our lab uses Googledocs to set agendas, record decisions made, and outline action items during meetings. Each lab member has their own google doc for their 1:1 meetings with Joan. Prior to each meeting, create your agenda for that meeting there.

## How we communicate
We mostly send emails to each other for general communications or we use Slack for coding and project-related issues/questions. 

## How we give feedback

Feedback, both giving and receiving it, is an important aspect of our lab. Most of the feedback we give and receive is when giving and attending practice talks. We expect feedback to be supportive but constructive.

This [resource from UBC](https://scwrl.ubc.ca/student-resources/learning-strategies-for-communicating-science/how-to-give-and-receive-effective-feedback/) does a really great job of outlining the main points of how to give and receive feedback.

## How we share things (and send them to Joan)

We think it is useful to have standard ways of sharing things. These don't always have to be followed but are a useful guide and will make things easier. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you.

Taking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this.

Project management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses. Use 'Issues' on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Alternatively, make use of a GoogleDoc for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook.

Code: can be shared via Github repositories. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared.

Writing: Preferably via GoogleDoc or MS Word documents (other options are OK but most of us won't know how to use them well). Google docs are particularly useful for collaborative writing, and have the advantage of there only ever being one version (as opposed to files that are sent around via email). Word documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (e.g. please no "mythesis.doc").

## Shared lab resources

Where to find shared resources: [LOC Lab Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aQzLoTCmUwdSaAPyrhzgAo8GqpBVOsOQ?usp=drive_link) - You will be given access to the shared drive during onboarding. Take a look at the Lab Meetings folder to find Lab Meeting Notes for each semester.

## Coding environment

We have our own [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Landscapes-of-Change-Lab)! You will be given access to use this organization where you can collaborate on projects with LOC Labbies. We follow Open Science Principles, and it all starts here, with the GitHub organization.
