# Open Data Science


## Our committment to Open Data Science
We are committed to advancing open data science by promoting transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in all research endeavors. We ensure that our data, methods, and code are accessible to the broader scientific community, fostering innovation through the sharing of resources. By adhering to open science principles, we aim to accelerate discoveries and encourage inclusive participation in scientific research.

## How we build reproducible code
First, we have our own [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Landscapes-of-Change-Lab). You will be added to the organization when you arrive; please ask one of the lab members if you need to be added.

Second, since most of the lab members use R, we use this github organization to create teams and repositories for our different projects. This enables us to collaborate easily within the lab.

Third, we often perform code review because no one is perfect, but together we are better!
